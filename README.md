# chrome-dino-pygame
----------------------
This is my first pygame project.
I followed a few parts of this tutorial to create a runner game: https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk

**To play this game:**
  1. Download python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Download pygame with this command: `pip install pygame`
  3. Run the python file 'Chrome Dino.py'

**If the pygame installation goes wrong:**

  **'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.**

   Add `C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[your version of python]\Scripts` to your PATH environnement variables and run the commmand again

  **Encountered error while generating package metadata.**

   Run the command `pip install pygame --pre` this will install an older version of pygame
