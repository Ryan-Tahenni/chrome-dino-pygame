# chrome-dino-pygame
----------------------
This is my first pygame project.
I followed a few parts of this tutorial to create a runner game: https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk

**To play this game:**
  1. Download python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Download pygame with this command: `pip install pygame`
  3. Download the repo
  4. Run the python file 'Chrome Dino.py'
