# chrome-dino-pygame
This is my first pygame project.
I followed a few parts of this tutorial to create a runner game: https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk

**To play this game:**
  1. Download python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Download pygame with this command: `pip install pygame`
  3. Run the python file 'main.py'

**If the pygame installation goes wrong:**

  **"pip is not recognised as a command:"**

   Add pip to your PATH environnement variables and run the commmand again

  **"error while generating metadata:"**

   Run the command `pip install pygame --pre` this will install an older version of pygame
